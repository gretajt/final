I put together this list of book titles in response to the 2020 George Floyd uprisings, which were taking place while I was learning beginning website development.

These are 10 books about the history of policing and prisons in the U.S. from a critical, abolitionist perspective. 
The movement for police abolition includes the abolition of the prison-industrial complex (PIC).
It also demands the development and implementation of new transformative justice and accountability practices for community survival and safety.

I hope these books can be informative for the movement.

8 of the 10 titles are available as e-books. Of those 8 e-book titles, 5 are available for free as of June 2020.
